#### Zeit™ test app #2 - trying out auto-deployment for every push with [Zeit™](https://zeit.co) [Now™](https://zeit.co/now). Receives an HLS stream and streams it back from a different port. [`[Node.js]`](https://nodejs.org)
###### *An app from apps suite to test some Node.js stuff (streams, sockets, ffmpeg etc) when deployed at Zeit™.*

### ToDo:

- [x] <sup>**0.0.2**</sup> <del>Fix problem with simultaneous `@now/static-build` & `@now/node` builds.</del> <sub>*(Moved back to pre-building the deployment package (in this case only a single transpile of `src/index.js` to `index.js`) and manually deploying it via `now; now alias`. To prevent (failed) attempts to autodeploy on GitHub™ commits added `/index.js` to `.gitignore`.)*</sub>

  - [x] <sup>**0.0.2**</sup> <del>Forbid autodeployments on GitHub™ commits via a proper `now.json` setting (as opposed to hiding the `@now/node` builder source file `/index.js`, which leads to unnecessary error messages from Now™ GitHub™ bot).</del> <sub>*(Added `..."github":{"enabled":false,...}...` to `now.json`. Proved to be a very much self-evident proposition.)*</sub>
  
- [x] <sup>**0.0.2**</sup> <del>Generate and setup required logos & icons.</del>

- [ ] <sup>**0.0.2**</sup> Add a simplest stream retranslation service (a bounce - you upload a file and immediately get it back as a download. [push logic]:

  - [ ] <sup>**0.0.2**</sup> Add a simple (stream) transform for the file, e.g. on-the-fly compression.
  
  - [ ] <sup>**0.0.2**</sup> Measure performance with a ~1GB file streamed to and back from the **`λ`** in question.

  - [ ] <sup>**0.0.2**</sup> Implement a C-based transformer utility of the same semantics, deploy it, measure & compare performance gain, if any.

- [ ] <sup><sup>0.0.3</sup></sup> Add HLS video stream retranslation service [push logic]:

  - [ ] <sup><sup>0.0.3</sup></sup> Detect incoming HLS stream at one port and
  
  - [ ] <sup><sup>0.0.3</sup></sup> Broadcast it via another port, unchanged.

- [ ] <sup><sup>0.0.3</sup></sup> Add a simple quasi real-time monitor interface, to display current status of (the) retranslation.

- [ ] <sup><sup>0.0.4</sup></sup> Add HLS video stream retranslation service [pull logic]:

  - [ ] <sup><sup>0.0.4</sup></sup> Detect request for HLS stream at one port and
  
  - [ ] <sup><sup>0.0.4</sup></sup> Access the pre-set source stream at another port and
  
  - [ ] <sup><sup>0.0.4</sup></sup> Serve the (unchanged) source stream to the requesting client.

- [ ] <sup><sup>0.0.5</sup></sup> Make monitor interface into a proper PWA (installable and all) - will serve as a basis for the (future) client app.

- [ ] <sup><sup>0.0.5</sup></sup> Add serving clients' web interface.

- [ ] <sup><sup>0.0.6</sup></sup> Add some convenient form of authentication for push logic stream retranslation scheme for both:

  - [ ] <sup><sup>0.0.6</sup></sup> Client, providing the source HLS stream and
  
  - [ ] <sup><sup>0.0.6</sup></sup> Client, consuming the retranslated (broadcasting) HLS stream.

- [ ] <sup><sup>0.0.7</sup></sup> Add some convenient form of authentication for pull logic stream retranslation scheme for both:

  - [ ] <sup><sup>0.0.7</sup></sup> Server, providing us with the source HLS stream (it authenticates with us, which grants it the power to setup our credentials to authenticate with it when we receive a clients' request and in turn request it to provide us with the source HLS stream) and

  - [ ] <sup><sup>0.0.7</sup></sup> Client, requesting the retranslated HLS stream from us.
  
- [ ] <sup><sup>0.0.8</sup></sup> Add the end clients' web interface (possibly as a sub-view of serving clients' one, after all it's their target audience).
